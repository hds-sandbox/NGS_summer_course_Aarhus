    "In this exercise, you identified polymorphisms between the two white clover subgenomes using Hifi reads alignment files and SNPs specific for the white clover Tienshan genotype using RNA-seq alignment files. You learned how to import VCF files in Python to extract data and created plots. You also filtered low-quality variants from the VCF files and counted genotypes. \n",
