    "This tutorial will cover the steps for performing the alignment of raw RNA- and HiFi-sequencing data. You will need to use [the software IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download) on your computer to visualize some of the output files, which can be easily downloaded once they are produced. At the end of this tutorial you will be able to:\n",
    "- perform and discuss quality control on raw data in `fastq` format using `FastQC` and `MultiQC`\n",
    "- align HiFi and RNA sequencing data with dedicated tools such as `MiniMap2` and `STAR`\n",
    "- analyze the quality the alignment with `qualimap` \n",
    "The output of this notebook will be used for the Variant calling analysis and the bulk RNA-sequencing analysis. If you do not want to run this notebook, you can alternatively use [the free interactive tool Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) to perform the alignment steps. We have uploaded the data on Galaxy, and the manual to perform the exercise is found at the course webpage !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.\n",

    "A few introductory points to run this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To use this notebook, use the `NGS (python)` kernel that contains the packages. Choose it by selecting `Kernel -> Change Kernel` in the menu on top of the window.\n",

    "\n",
    "* In this notebook you will use only bash commands as you would do in the command line (this is why you read `%%bash` at the beginning of each piece of code). Those commands can be replicated in the command line, but we thought of integrating them in a notebook to make the tutorial understandable. The bash commands can also be marked with an `!` sign at the beginning of the line\n",
    "* On some computers, you might see the result of the commands once they are done running. This means you will wait some time while the computer is crunching, and only afterwards you will see the result of the command you have executed\n",
    "*  You can run the code in each cell by clicking on the run cell button, or by pressing <kbd> Shift </kbd> + <kbd> Enter </kbd>.  When the code is done running, a small green check sign will appear on the left side\n",
    "*   You need to run the cells in sequential order, please do not run a cell until the one above finished running and do not skip any cells\n",
    "*   Each cell contains a short description of the code and the output you should get. Please try not to focus on understanding the code for each command in too much detail, but rather try to focus on the output \n",
    "*   You can create new code cells by pressing <kbd> + </kbd> in the Menu bar above. \n",

    "White clover (Trifolium repens) is an allotetraploid.  It is a relatively young, outcrossing species, which originated during the most recent glaciation around 20,000 years ago by hybridisation of two diploid species, T. occidentale and T. pallescens (see figure below). \n",

    "This means that it contains genomes originating from two different species within the same nucleus. Normally, white clover is an outbreeding species, but a self-compatible line was used for sequencing the white clover genome [(Griffiths et al, 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/31/7/1466/5985684). This line will be \n",
    "designated as `S10` in the data, indicating that this is the 10th self-fertilized generation. In addition, we have data from a wild clover accession (ecotype) called Tienshan (`Ti`), which is collected from the Chinese mountains and is adapted to alpine conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform alignment of the data to the white clover's reference genome containing both T. occidentale and T. pallescens (called `contig 1` and `contig 2` in the data). We will also perform alignment to each subgenome, and see which are the differences with the quality control tools."
