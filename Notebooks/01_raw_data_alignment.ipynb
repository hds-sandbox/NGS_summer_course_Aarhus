For example, you need to download both `results/HIFI_alignment/PacBio_clover_alignment_1.sort.bam` and `results/HIFI_alignment/PacBio_clover_alignment_1.sort.bam.bai` to see this alignment (you need to open only the `.bam` file with IGV). If you open more files, their alignments will be distributed in the IGV interface, and you can change the size of each visualization yourself (below shown with only one opened alignment).\n",

    "In the `../Data` folder you will find 24 RNA-seq libraries, 12 `S10` libraries and 12  `Tienshan` libraries. Each library is paired-end, which is denoted by `R1` and `R2` at the end of two files having the same name, such as `S10_1_1.R1.fastq` and `S10_1_1.R2.fastq`. We will align each library separately and then merge the alignments to create two final samples for `S10` and `Tienshan`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to create a genome file for the reference fasta file of contigs `1` and `2`. This is done with `STAR`, using the option `--runMode genomeGenerate`. We also need to convert the gene annotation from `gff` to `gtf` format with `gffread` to allow counting gene transcripts. `STAR` is a very complex tool with many options, so it is always useful to [have a reference manual](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/skrabanek/lab/angsd/lecture_notes/STARmanual.pdf)."
