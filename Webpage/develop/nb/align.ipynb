You can find the report for each file into the folder `results/fastqc_output/`. The output is in HTML format and can be opened in any browser or in `jupyterlab`.

    "\n",
    "In the `../Data` folder you will find 24 RNA-seq libraries, 12 `S10` libraries and 12  `Tienshan` libraries. Each library is paired-end, which is denoted by `R1` and `R2` at the end of two files having the same name, such as `S10_1_1.R1.fastq` and `S10_1_1.R2.fastq`. We will align each library separately and then merge the alignments to create two final samples for `S10` and `Tienshan`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to create a genome file for the reference fasta file of contigs `1` and `2`. This is done with `STAR`, using the option `--runMode genomeGenerate`. We also need to convert the gene annotation from `gff` to `gtf` format with `gffread` to allow counting gene transcripts. `STAR` is a very complex tool with many options, so it is always useful to [have a reference manual](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/skrabanek/lab/angsd/lecture_notes/STARmanual.pdf)."
