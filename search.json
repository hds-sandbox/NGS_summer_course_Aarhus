Once you are an approved user of UCloud, you are met with a dashboard interface as below. Here you can see a summary of the workspace you are using, like the hours of computing, the storage available, and other informations. The workspace you are working on is shown in the top-right corner (red circle).

The Files window will open. Here you can create drives, which are virtual storage units resembling the drives of a computer, where you can store, delete and move files around.\nChoose the workspace My workspace and create a drive using the button on top of the window (Create drive), choose the resources available from the dropdown menu (in the workspace My workspace you probably have u1-cephfs) and assign a name.\nNow you have created your drive inside your personal workspace! You can create other drives, for example to keep projects separate. If you click into the drive, you can see new top buttons, for example to upload a file, create a folder and sync with another computer (which needs a software - click on the Sync button to read more). When you have a drive, you can mount it into a software you want to use (mount means to make it available for the software to read/write from and to).\nRemember to go back to the workspace you were working with before this exercise.\n\n\n4. The left-side can also be used to access applications, running programs and settings. Use the Applications symbol (red circle) and click on the Health Science store (green circle).\n\n5. Your screen will show some softwaress falling in the Health Science subcategory. Click on the Genomics Sandbox application to open its settings.\n\n6.

You can always find all your active and stopped sessions in the left toolbar of ucloud, under Jobs. Here you can click on your current session and see again the tab you closed!\n\n\n9. The Jupyterlab interface looks as below. It has a launcher from which you can start notebooks (documents including code and outputs) and terminals from scratch. On the left-side of the screen you have a file browser. You want to use the notebooks for this course, which you can find under the folder Notebooks.\n\n10. Now you can choose the notebooks. They are ordered by course topic and contain both explanations and code which you can run to see what happens. Double-click on the first notebook: you can see there are instructions to make sure the notebook works, and at some point you start see some code cells between the text, as in figure below.\n\n11. Cells always need to run from the first to the last in the order they have been written. To run a cell, select it and click the arrow-like symbol in the toolbar:\n\nAlternatively, press Shift+Enter on your keyboard, which is much more practical. Every time a code cell is running, a star simbol will show on its side. When it is done, a number will show, telling you the step number of the code you have been running. If a command shows an output, it will be visualized directly on the notebook. Use the toolbar to save the notebook, and edit it in any way you need adding text notes or code (you can add new cells via the toolbar).\n\n\nAccess again previously used notebooks and data\nIf you need to reuse the notebooks and the data used in a previous session, this can be done easily. Everything you produced during the notebook execution, and the notebooks themselves, are saved in your personal drive of the workspace. This has a name of the type NameSurname#Number. You need to add the folders Data and Notebooks from you previous session. Follow these steps:\n \n1.

The funded Sandbox proposal focused on generating synthetic data using mechanistic models, agent-based models, or draws from multivariate distributions (such as copulas), which are methods that do not present any significant GDPR-related concerns with sharing the produced datasets as they are derived from population-level characteristics and prior knowledge. However, new deep learning-based methods of data synthesis can theoretically learn complex, nonlinear patterns within a sensitive dataset and generate a synthetic dataset that replicates these patterns. This is a really promising approach for sharing high utility synthetic datasets, but it also elevates risk of accidentally sharing too much about the real dataset and skirting the boundaries of GDPR and ethical data handling. There is an inherent trade-off between privacy preservation and similarity of the synthetic dataset to the original dataset, with method development focused on moving closer to the ideal zone of high privacy AND high similarity. The figure at right is a rough approximation of this relationship versus current families of synthesis methods.\nPlease see Synthetic Data for more information about our approach to this technology."

    "text": "It is necessary to clarify what we mean when we refer to synthetic data within the Sandbox project. While the term has been used for decades to describe all kinds of ‘non-real’ data including those derived from models and simulations, developments in deep generative modeling have dramatically expanded our understanding of what synthetic data can be. In the age of deepfakes and news articles written entirely by ChatGPT, synthetic data derived from deep learning is in a wholly different class from data simulated with a mechanistic or agent-based model.\nThe Sandbox is actually interested in any form of synthetic data - our highest priority is providing safe-to-use data to trainees and researchers that does not raise any concerns about sensitive data with respect to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and local Danish data regulations. So, we are using both old school and new school forms of data synthesis. However, the discussion on this page is heavily weighted towards our interest in new school synthesis - with our connections to generative modeling researchers and high quality data, we are naturally interested in figuring out a safe way to deploy synthetic datasets derived from deep learning and other high similarity approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TLDR for synthetic data in the Sandbox\n\n\n\n- The development of synthetic datasets should be viewed as a research project. The technology is generally untested with few examples of public roll-out, and its deployment should be future-proofed as much as possible against attacks and potential sensitive data disclosure.\n- Synthetic data generation and evaluation approaches should be tailored     to each dataset of interest. With current technology, it is unlikely that high quality, safe-to-share datasets will be produced at any kind of production scale without a massive effort devoted to pre-processing, data harmonization, and customized routines for different families of datasets.\n- The Sandbox is not openly sharing any synthetic datasets generated from person-specific sensitive data. We think these datasets will be useful to approved researchers that ideally gain access via an approved data portal with registration and data use agreements with relevant data authorities. We are not currently that portal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have explored the performance of copulas, multiple imputation, sequential synthesis, and several generative adversarial network (GAN) approaches with a cancer dataset which we were developing for a course in the MS in Personal Medicine program at University of Copenhagen. We quickly discovered that factors such as missingness, collinearity, and the ratio of patients to features cause just as many problems for synthetic data generation as they do in predictive modeling. We are currently evaluating the above techniques as well as additional deep learning approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Bayesian graphs against a collection of benchmark health datasets to better understand the positives and negatives of each technique when faced with common challenges in real world health data.\nRecently, a few interesting libraries / pipelines have been released that enable testing of different synthetic data generation approaches alongside a range of evaluation metrics. We are actively exploring these tools as we test different generation approaches and examining their implementation of evaluation metrics. We plan to add additional components and features as we resolve challenges with different target datasets.\n\n\n\nThere are 3 key principles to consider when judging the overall quality of a synthetic dataset: fidelity to the original dataset, risk to privacy, and prediction utility. Fidelity and utility are often grouped together as similarity to the original data which exists in a trade-off with privacy - the more similar your synthetic dataset to the original, the higher your risk to patient privacy. However, the distinction between them is important as they can be achieved independently of each other depending on the project frame. Fidelity refers to reproduction of the multivariate shape and structure of the original data (including complex nonlinear relationships) while utility refers to how well the synthetic dataset matches the predictive accuracy of the original dataset. Risk to privacy includes both risk of patient reidentification and risk of sensitive information disclosure about a patient. There are many proposed evaluation metrics for measuring different aspects of these three qualities. We are actively investigating the performance of these metrics against our different datasets.\n\nWe should point out that while using quantitative metrics to assess privacy preservation is a critical step in creating a synthetic dataset, positive results do not absolve us from any concerns regarding risk to privacy in the synthetic data. Regulatory guidelines regarding the safety of synthetic data and the ability to openly share it are extremely unclear. No authorities have specified quantitative cut-offs using these metrics that enable open release, for example. For this reason, we have developed our own internal guidelines for how to handle this aspect of the project, which are based on a comprehensive examination of relevant EU and Danish legislation (i.e. the GDPR, the Artificial Intelligence Act, the Danish Health Law, and the Danish Data Protection Act). We continue work on synthesis with hope that new legislation such as the development of the European Health Data Space will provide further guidance in the future.\n\n\n\nWe are currently focused on exploring methods and metrics by developing reproducible, well documented examples and use cases of synthetic data in partnership with other researchers, legal advisors, and data authorities. We’re relying primarily on publicly available tabular health datasets in this exploration phase, but we will also work with sensitive data in the future. Our rules aim to preserve the trust of the public in how their health data is handled by data authorities and researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandbox Rules for Synthetic Data\n\n\n\n1. Creation of synthetic data involves processing sensitive data, and this requires obtaining project approvals from data authorities when performing this work on sensitive data. Any synthetic data work with restricted-access, sensitive data by the Sandbox will only be conducted with these approvals in place in the frame of a research project.\n2. Goals for each synthetic dataset project should be defined at project initiation: how will the synthetic dataset be used, who is the intended audience, and how might it be shared? This frame should govern every consequent decision for that dataset and be shared alongside the final dataset.\n3. Quantitative metrics for fidelity, utility, and privacy preservation should be implemented for each dataset and shared alongside the final dataset.\n4. A cost-benefit analysis should be performed after the project is completed - is any risk to privacy appropriately balanced by value of the dataset in achieving its stated aims and contributing to the public good?\n5. Data authorities with ethical and strategic stakes in who accesses the synthetic dataset should be included in decisions about how it is used and who is allowed to access it. \n6. Synthetic datasets created from person-specific sensitive data rather than population characteristics can still pose privacy risks, and any users of the dataset should be approved and registered. The Sandbox will not release any such datasets publicly and will instead work with appropriate data authorities to decide how such datasets should be governed in a responsible way."

So, we are using both old school and new school forms of data synthesis. However, the discussion on this page is heavily weighted towards our interest in new school synthesis - with our connections to generative modeling researchers and high quality data, we are naturally interested in figuring out a safe way to deploy synthetic datasets derived from deep learning and other high similarity approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TLDR for synthetic data in the Sandbox\n\n\n\n- The development of synthetic datasets should be viewed as a research project. The technology is generally untested with few examples of public roll-out, and its deployment should be future-proofed as much as possible against attacks and potential sensitive data disclosure.\n- Synthetic data generation and evaluation approaches should be tailored     to each dataset of interest. With current technology, it is unlikely that high quality, safe-to-share datasets will be produced at any kind of production scale without a massive effort devoted to pre-processing, data harmonization, and customized routines for different families of datasets.\n- The Sandbox is not openly sharing any synthetic datasets generated from person-specific sensitive data. We think these datasets will be useful to approved researchers that ideally gain access via an approved data portal with registration and data use agreements with relevant data authorities. We are not currently that portal."

    "text": "We have explored the performance of copulas, multiple imputation, sequential synthesis, and several generative adversarial network (GAN) approaches with a cancer dataset which we were developing for a course in the MS in Personal Medicine program at University of Copenhagen. We quickly discovered that factors such as missingness, collinearity, and the ratio of patients to features cause just as many problems for synthetic data generation as they do in predictive modeling. We are currently evaluating the above techniques as well as additional deep learning approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Bayesian graphs against a collection of benchmark health datasets to better understand the positives and negatives of each technique when faced with common challenges in real world health data.\nRecently, a few interesting libraries / pipelines have been released that enable testing of different synthetic data generation approaches alongside a range of evaluation metrics. We are actively exploring these tools as we test different generation approaches and examining their implementation of evaluation metrics. We plan to add additional components and features as we resolve challenges with different target datasets."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are 3 key principles to consider when judging the overall quality of a synthetic dataset: fidelity to the original dataset, risk to privacy, and prediction utility. Fidelity and utility are often grouped together as similarity to the original data which exists in a trade-off with privacy - the more similar your synthetic dataset to the original, the higher your risk to patient privacy. However, the distinction between them is important as they can be achieved independently of each other depending on the project frame. Fidelity refers to reproduction of the multivariate shape and structure of the original data (including complex nonlinear relationships) while utility refers to how well the synthetic dataset matches the predictive accuracy of the original dataset. Risk to privacy includes both risk of patient reidentification and risk of sensitive information disclosure about a patient. There are many proposed evaluation metrics for measuring different aspects of these three qualities. We are actively investigating the performance of these metrics against our different datasets.\n\nWe should point out that while using quantitative metrics to assess privacy preservation is a critical step in creating a synthetic dataset, positive results do not absolve us from any concerns regarding risk to privacy in the synthetic data. Regulatory guidelines regarding the safety of synthetic data and the ability to openly share it are extremely unclear. No authorities have specified quantitative cut-offs using these metrics that enable open release, for example. For this reason, we have developed our own internal guidelines for how to handle this aspect of the project, which are based on a comprehensive examination of relevant EU and Danish legislation (i.e. the GDPR, the Artificial Intelligence Act, the Danish Health Law, and the Danish Data Protection Act). We continue work on synthesis with hope that new legislation such as the development of the European Health Data Space will provide further guidance in the future."

We’re relying primarily on publicly available tabular health datasets in this exploration phase, but we will also work with sensitive data in the future. Our rules aim to preserve the trust of the public in how their health data is handled by data authorities and researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandbox Rules for Synthetic Data\n\n\n\n1. Creation of synthetic data involves processing sensitive data, and this requires obtaining project approvals from data authorities when performing this work on sensitive data. Any synthetic data work with restricted-access, sensitive data by the Sandbox will only be conducted with these approvals in place in the frame of a research project.\n2. Goals for each synthetic dataset project should be defined at project initiation: how will the synthetic dataset be used, who is the intended audience, and how might it be shared? This frame should govern every consequent decision for that dataset and be shared alongside the final dataset.\n3. Quantitative metrics for fidelity, utility, and privacy preservation should be implemented for each dataset and shared alongside the final dataset.\n4. A cost-benefit analysis should be performed after the project is completed - is any risk to privacy appropriately balanced by value of the dataset in achieving its stated aims and contributing to the public good?\n5. Data authorities with ethical and strategic stakes in who accesses the synthetic dataset should be included in decisions about how it is used and who is allowed to access it. \n6. Synthetic datasets created from person-specific sensitive data rather than population characteristics can still pose privacy risks, and any users of the dataset should be approved and registered. The Sandbox will not release any such datasets publicly and will instead work with appropriate data authorities to decide how such datasets should be governed in a responsible way."

    "text": "An infrastructure project for health data science training and research in Denmark\nThe National Health Data Science Sandbox project kicked off in 2021 with 5 years of funding via the Data Science Research Infrastructure initiative from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Health data science experts at five Danish universities are contributing to the Sandbox with coordination from the Center for Health Data Science under lead PI Professor Anders Krogh. Data scientists hosted in the research groups of each PI are building infrastructure and training modules on Computerome and UCloud, the primary academic high performance computing (HPC) platforms in Denmark. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch with one of our data scientists, please contact us here.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur computational ‘sandbox’ allows data scientists to explore datasets, tools and analysis pipelines in the same high performance computing environments where real research projects are conducted. Rather than a single, hefty environment, we’re deploying modularized topical environments tailored for independent use on each HPC platform. We aim to support three key user groups based at Danish universities:\n\ntrainees: use our training modules to learn analysis techniques with some guidance and guardrails - for your data type of interest AND for general good practices for HPC environments\n\nresearchers: prototype your tools and algorithms with an array of good quality datasets that are GDPR compliant and free to access\neducators: develop your next course with computational assignments in the HPC environment your students will use for their research\n\nActivity developing independent training modules and hosting workshops has centered on UCloud, while collaborative construction of a flexible Course Platform has been completed on Computerome for use by the Sandbox and independent educators. Publicly sourced datasets are being used in training modules on UCloud, while generation of synthetic data is an ongoing project at Computerome. Sandbox resources are under active construction, so check out our other pages for the current status on HPC Access, Datasets, and Modules. We run workshops using completed training modules on a regular basis and provide active support for Sandbox-hosted courses through a slack workspace. See our Contact page for more information.\n\n\nPartner with the Sandbox\nThe Sandbox welcomes proposals for new courses, modules, and prototyping projects from researchers and educators. We’d like to partner with lecturers engaged with us in developing needed materials collaboratively - we would love to have input from subject experts or help promote exciting new tools and analysis methods via modules! Please contact us with your ideas at nhds_sandbox@sund.ku.dk.\n\nWe thank the Novo Nordisk Foundation for funding support. If you use the Sandbox for research or reference it in text or presentations, please acknowledge the Health Data Science Sandbox project and its funder the Novo Nordisk Foundation (grant number NNF20OC0063268)."

    "text": "Access Sandbox resources\nOur first choice is to provide all the training materials, tutorials, and tools as interactive apps on UCloud, the supercomputer located at the University of Southern Denmark. Anyone using these resources needs the following:\n\na Danish university ID so you can sign on to UCloud via WAYF1.\n\n \n\n for UCloud Access click here \n\n \n\nbasic ability to navigate in Linux/RStudio/Jupyter. You don’t need to be an expert, but it is beyond our ambitions (and course material) to teach you how to code from zero and how to run analyses simultaneously. We recommend a basic R or Python course before diving in.\nFor workshop participants: Use our invite link to the correct UCloud workspace that will be shared on the day of the workshop. This way, we can provide you with compute resources for the active sessions of the workshop2 Click the link below after your first uCloud access and accept the invite that shows.\n\n \n\n Invite link to uCloud workspace \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOur apps can run on other clusters, simply by pulling a so-called docker container. You only need to have either docker or singularity installed on the cluster. GenomeDK supports singularity and thus can run our learning material as well. Ask us if you want to help the apps out of uCloud. Instructions will soon be available within our HPC access instructions."

You will try two apps during the workshop, but we are developing others, and have deployed three apps already.\n \n\n\n\nProteomics Sandbox: Our sandbox modern with a suite of proteomics analysis tools, used for example in clinical proteomics. This app is not alone, since our data scientist Jacob has also made the app ColabFold on UCloud, with methods for protein structure prediction.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTranscriptomics Sandbox : Our sandbox for bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and visualization - amongst others two regular workshops and provides stand-alone visualization tools. In the next update, we will introduce advanced tutorials for more complex single-cell RNA sequencing analysis from some of our supported courses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nGenomics Sandbox: Our sandbox NGS data analysis and applications range from genome assembly to variant calling to metagenomics. We have currently a semester-long population genomics course and an NGS course with many applications (alignment, VCF analysis, bulk-RNA data, single-cell RNA sequencing)"

If you are totally toast for the day, remember that you can check out longer versions of our tutorials as well as other topics and tools in each of the Sandbox modules or join us for a multi-day in-person course (follow our news here).\nAs data scientists, we also would be really happy for some quantifiable info and feedback - we want to build things that the Danish health data science community is excited to use. Please answer these 5 questions for us before you head out for the day 3.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice meeting you and we hope to see you again!"
